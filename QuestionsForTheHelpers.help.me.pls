1) The obvious how do we get the firing raster plots to look like the ones in the notes!

2) To get S for our neural complexity function to use, do we do something like S = aks_diff(aks_diff(firings'))'

3) Neural complexity - is Xi referring to the rows or columns? Is it an individual sample or is X1 time and X2 neuron number?
